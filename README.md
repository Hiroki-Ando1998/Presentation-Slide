## Advantages of using Reveal.js
- Highly responsive even when handling large presentation can be published directly as a web page.
- Can be hosted on platforms such as GitHub Pages, university servers, or personal websites, making them accessible via a simple URL without the need for file downloads or PDF conversion. it can be viewed smoothly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- High level of reproducibility across different environments: the appearance and layout remain consistent, regardless of operating system, software version, or installed fonts, as long as the presentation is viewed in a modern web browser.

Once the basic structure of HTML is mastered,
- Reveal.js also works extremely well with Git and GitHub, enabling precise version control of slides.
- Strong support for mathematical expressions, code, and technical figures. Mathematical notation can be rendered using MathJax or KaTeX, providing a workflow that is very close to LaTeX and avoiding resolution loss or formatting inconsistencies.
- Fine-grained control over visual presentation through CSS. Elements such as slide numbers, navigation controls, margins, backgrounds, fonts, and even screen-size-dependent behavior can be adjusted at the pixel level.
- Reveal.js integrates well with AI-assisted coding tools
- Can use HTML-based slides generated by Notebook LM or　Canvas, other AI directly, allowing high-quality presentations to be created rapidly. In this case, PDF file may be needed to be converted into HTML file, using online tool, Google slide or other tools.
- Once a template is in place, creating new slides becomes almost instantaneous.


## Setting Up Reveal.js on GitHub
1. Download reveal.js from [GitHub](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)
2. Open a web browser and search for “reveal.js” on GitHub, then access the official repository named hakimel/reveal.js. On the repository page,
3. Click the green “Code” button and select “Download ZIP” from the menu.
4. Extract the downloaded ZIP file. On Windows, navigate to your Downloads folder, right-click the ZIP file, and choose “Extract All.” After extraction, a folder such as reveal.js-5.x.x will be created.
5. Open this folder and check its contents carefully. Inside, you will see directories such as dist, plugin, css, and js, along with files like index.html, package.json. (These files and folders are what you need for reveal.js to work.) 
6. Copy only the contents of the extracted folder into your own repository.
7. Check your repository contains **index.html** at the top level along with directories such as dist, plugin, css, and js, then the setup is correct.
8. Create a folder for storing images (eg,1_Images)
9. Create a folder for storing HTML codes (eg, 2_HTML)

### Connecting VScode with GitHub and updating
1. Open your project folder in VS Code
2. Press Ctrl + Shift + P to open the Command Palette. In the Command Palette, type “Git: Clone” and select it.
3. Select a folder in your local (eg, download, document, USB)
4. Complete the process of connecting with GitHub
5. After editing file, click "Source Control icon" on the left side of VS Code.
6. Check whether index.html appears in the list of files. When the Source Control panel is open, you should see a section labeled Changes, and under it an entry such as M index.html.
7. Type a message into the message input box at the top of the Source Control panel.
8. Click the checkmark (✔) icon next to the message box. 


### Creating slides and uploading online
1. Put pictures in the folder (2_Images)
2. Revise the code to put the pictures in a slide, using the [template](https://github.com/Hiroki-Ando1998/Presentation-Slide/blob/main/2_HTML/00_Template_white.html)
3. Uploading the slide:"setting"→"Pages"→"main, /root"→"save", wait for a comple minutes
4. Enter "htttps://USER.github.io/REPOSITORY/FolderName/FileName.html.For example: https://hiroki-ando1998.github.io/Presentation-Slide/2_HTML/00_Template_white.html
